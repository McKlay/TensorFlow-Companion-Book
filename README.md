## ðŸ“˜ What This Is

The **TensorFlow Builderâ€™s Companion Book** is a personal guide and practical reference to mastering TensorFlow â€” structured like a living technical notebook.

It blends step-by-step tutorials, narrative explanations, and real-world examples across:

- Tensor mechanics (indexing, broadcasting, special tensors)
- Model-building (Keras APIs, layers, loss, training logic)
- Natural Language Processing (tokenization, RNNs, Transformers)
- Computer Vision (CNNs, image classification, GANs)
- Production tools (TF Lite, TFX, Hugging Face)

Whether youâ€™re experimenting, preparing for interviews, or deploying ML systems, this book helps you go deep â€” cleanly and confidently.
