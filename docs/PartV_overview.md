# Part V Summary: Computer Vision in TensorFlow

Part V takes us from sequences of words to arrays of pixels. In this section, we explore how machines can see, interpret, and generate images using TensorFlow’s deep learning tools.

Computer Vision is one of the most impactful applications of AI—spanning everything from photo tagging and medical imaging to self-driving cars and generative art. This part guides you through the essential building blocks of vision systems, using both classic convolutional networks and cutting-edge techniques like GANs.

Here’s what you’ll master across Chapters 26 to 32:

✅ Chapter 26: Convolution Layers & CNNs
Understand how convolutional layers work and why they’re ideal for spatial data like images. You’ll build your first Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and visualize how filters extract features like edges and textures.

✅ Chapter 27: Data Augmentation
Boost your model’s generalization by simulating real-world variations through flipping, rotation, zooming, and brightness changes. You’ll explore TensorFlow’s image preprocessing pipeline and the tf.image and ImageDataGenerator APIs.

✅ Chapter 28: Image Classification
Train a CNN to classify images into categories using popular datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST. This chapter walks you through the full pipeline—from loading data to evaluating your model’s performance on test images.

✅ Chapter 29: Object Detection
Go beyond classification and detect what and where objects are in an image. You’ll explore bounding boxes, Intersection over Union (IoU), and modern object detection models like SSD and YOLO in TensorFlow.

✅ Chapter 30: Face Mask Detection
Build a real-world application that classifies whether a person is wearing a mask using transfer learning. You'll leverage pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 and fine-tune them for COVID-era use cases.

✅ Chapter 31: Image Segmentation
Segment images into pixel-level classes with models like U-Net or DeepLab. You'll learn the difference between semantic and instance segmentation—and how to label and train on pixel masks.

✅ Chapter 32: GANs for Image Generation
Explore the magical world of Generative Adversarial Networks. Learn how a generator and a discriminator play a zero-sum game to create photorealistic images. You'll build a simple GAN using TensorFlow and watch it learn to generate from noise.

After Part V, You Will Be Able To:

- Build and train CNNs for various vision tasks  
- Preprocess and augment image datasets for improved model robustness  
- Perform image classification, object detection, and segmentation  
- Use transfer learning for faster and more accurate vision models  
- Generate entirely new images using GANs

> Part V teaches machines to see—not just recognize, but detect, segment, and create. Welcome to the visual intelligence era.
