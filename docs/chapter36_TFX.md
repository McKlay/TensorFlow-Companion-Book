# Chapter 36: TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for Production Pipelines

> “*Models aren’t magic — they’re the output of a pipeline that’s reproducible, testable, and scalable.*”

## Introduction: From Experiment to Deployment

Training a model in a notebook is one thing — **deploying it at scale** in a robust production environment is a whole different story. That’s where TFX (TensorFlow Extended) comes in.

TFX is an end-to-end ML platform for **production-grade ML pipelines** built around TensorFlow. It handles:

- Data ingestion

- Data validation

- Feature engineering

- Model training

- odel validation

- Deployment

All with pipeline reproducibility, **CI/CD**, and version control baked in.

## Key Components of a TFX Pipeline

|Component	                |Purpose                                            |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|ExampleGen	                |Ingest and split raw data (CSV, TFRecord, etc.)    |
|StatisticsGen	            |Computes statistics over data                      |
|SchemaGen	                |Infers data schema from stats                      |
|ExampleValidator	        |Detects anomalies and missing values               |
|Transform	                |Performs feature engineering                       |
|Trainer	                |Trains a model using TensorFlow                    |
|Evaluator	                |Measures model quality (blessing or rejection)     |
|Pusher	                    |Pushes the model to serving environment            |

## Example: Building a TFX Pipeline (Basic)

```bash
pip install -q tfx
```
### Step 1: Directory Setup

```python
import os

PIPELINE_NAME = "sentiment_pipeline"
PIPELINE_ROOT = os.path.join("pipelines", PIPELINE_NAME)
METADATA_PATH = os.path.join("metadata", PIPELINE_NAME, "metadata.db")
```

---

### Define Pipeline Components

```python
from tfx.components import CsvExampleGen
from tfx.orchestration.experimental.interactive.interactive_context import InteractiveContext

context = InteractiveContext()

example_gen = CsvExampleGen(input_base="data/")
context.run(example_gen)
```
You can visualize the generated schema, examples, and anomalies with TensorBoard or Jupyter.

---

## Step 3: Feature Engineering and Model Training

```python
from tfx.components import Transform, Trainer
from tfx.proto import trainer_pb2

trainer = Trainer(
    module_file='model.py',  # Your model logic here
    examples=example_gen.outputs['examples'],
    train_args=trainer_pb2.TrainArgs(num_steps=1000),
    eval_args=trainer_pb2.EvalArgs(num_steps=500)
)
context.run(trainer)
```

---

## Step 4: Evaluating and Pushing

```python
from tfx.components import Evaluator, Pusher

evaluator = Evaluator(
    examples=example_gen.outputs['examples'],
    model=trainer.outputs['model']
)

pusher = Pusher(
    model=trainer.outputs['model'],
    push_destination=tfx.proto.pusher_pb2.PushDestination(
        filesystem=tfx.proto.pusher_pb2.PushDestination.Filesystem(
            base_directory="serving_model/"
        )
    )
)
context.run(pusher)
```

---

##  Optional: Orchestration Tools

TFX integrates with orchestrators like:

- **Apache Airflow**

- **Kubeflow Pipelines**

- **Vertex AI Pipelines** (GCP)

- **Dagster** (community)

This lets you **schedule**, **version**, and **monitor** your pipelines in production environments.

---

## Bonus Features

**Model Blessing**: Only deploy models that pass thresholds

**CI/CD for ML**: Automate training, evaluation, and deployment

**ML Metadata Tracking**: Reproducibility and lineage

**TensorBoard Integration**: For monitoring and debugging

---

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned:

- What TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is and why it matters in production

- How to build a simple TFX pipeline: ingest → validate → train → **deploy**

- How to scale with orchestration and **CI/CD** tools

- How TFX promotes **reliability**, **observability**, and **reproducibility** in ML workflows

TFX is your bridge between research and reality. It ensures your models are not only **accurate**, but also **trusted**, **trackable**, and **repeatable** in the messy world of production systems.
