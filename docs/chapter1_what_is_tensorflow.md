# TensorFlow Builder's Companion Book

Welcome to the official beginning of your TensorFlow journey—
A companion for builders, tinkerers, and deep learning dreamers.

# Chapter 1: What is TensorFlow?
> “With tensors as our bricks and computation graphs as our scaffold, we build minds from math.”

Imagine a massive data factory. At one end, raw data enters. At the other, intelligent predictions come out. In between? Conveyor belts, robotic arms, quality control systems—constantly crunching numbers, transforming data, and learning over time.

That’s TensorFlow.

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning, originally developed by the Google Brain team. It enables developers to:  

- Build and train neural networks

- Perform automatic differentiation

- Run models on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile devices, browsers, or servers

- Scale easily from research notebooks to production-ready pipelines

It’s not just a library—it’s an ecosystem.

## 1.1 Core Features at a Glance  

- `tf.Tensor`: the atomic unit of computation—just like PyTorch's `torch.Tensor`

- `tf.Variable`: trainable tensors for model weights

- `tf.GradientTape`: automatic differentiation engine

- `tf.data`: scalable input pipelines

- `tf.function`: compile Python into TensorFlow graph

- `tf.keras`: high-level API to define & train models

- `TFLite`, `TFX`, `TF-Serving`: deploy models to mobile, pipelines, or production

## 1.2 Quick Test: Check TensorFlow Installation & GPU

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def print_gpu_info():
    print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    print("Num GPUs Available:", len(gpus))
    for gpu in gpus:
        print("GPU Detected:", gpu.name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_gpu_info()
```
Save it as `check_tf_gpu.py` and run it with:

```python
python check_tf_gpu.py
```
You should see your GPU model (ex. NVIDIA RTX 4050 listed). If yes—welcome to GPU-accelerated machine learning.

## 1.3 Why TensorFlow (vs others)?

|Feature	                |TensorFlow	                    |PyTorch                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Graph Execution	        |@tf.function (static graph)	|Eager by default               |
|Mobile Deployment	        |TensorFlow Lite, TFLM	        |PyTorch Mobile (early stage)   |
|Production Pipelines	    |TensorFlow Extended (TFX)	    |TorchServe, FastAPI            |
|Debugging	                |Harder due to graphs	        |Easier due to eager mode       |
|Community	                |Huge (Google-backed)	        |Huge (Meta-backed)             |

In short: if you care about mobile deployment, large-scale production, or research+product fusion, TensorFlow is worth the climb.
