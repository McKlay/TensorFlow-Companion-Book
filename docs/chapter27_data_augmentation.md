# Chapter 27: Data Augmentation

“The best way to generalize is to never see the same image twice.”

## Why Augment Data?

When training a computer vision model, overfitting is a common enemy—especially when you have limited data. That's where data augmentation steps in. It’s a strategy to artificially expand your dataset by modifying existing images in subtle ways.

Think of it like teaching a child to recognize a cat, not just in one pose or lighting, but from every angle, distance, and background.

## Types of Augmentation

Here are common transformations applied in real-time:

|Augmentation Type	        |Description                            |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|Flip	                    |Horizontal or vertical reflection      |
|Rotation	                |Rotating image by a few degrees        |
|Zoom	                    |Zooming in/out randomly                |
|Shift	                    |Moving the image along height/width    |
|Shear	                    |Slanting the image slightly            |
|Brightness	                |Randomly adjusting the image lighting  |
|Noise	                    |Adding small pixel-level disturbances  |

##  TensorFlow Implementation – `tf.keras.preprocessing` vs `tf.image`

#### Option 1: With ImageDataGenerator (older API)

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)
```
Apply this to your training set:
```python
datagen.fit(train_images)
model.fit(datagen.flow(train_images, train_labels, batch_size=32), epochs=10)
```

---

#### Option 2: With `tf.keras.layers` (recommended)

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
    layers.RandomRotation(0.1),
    layers.RandomZoom(0.1),
    layers.RandomContrast(0.1)
])
```
You can use it like this in your model pipeline:
```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    data_augmentation,
    layers.Rescaling(1./255),
    layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    ...
])
```
This is more efficient and GPU-friendly.

## Benefits of Data Augmentation

- Improves model generalization  
- Reduces overfitting  
- Makes training robust to real-world distortions  
- Requires no extra labeled data

---

## Best Practices

- Don’t overdo it—too much distortion can confuse the model  
- Use augmentation only on the training set, never on validation/test  
- Combine augmentation with regularization (like dropout) for even better results

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned how data augmentation simulates a richer dataset from limited examples. By randomly flipping, rotating, zooming, and more, you can help your CNN see images as if in the wild—not just from a studio.
