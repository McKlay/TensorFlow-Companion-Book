# Part III Summary: Model Building with TensorFlow & Keras

In Part III, we shift gears from understanding tensors and computation to actually building trainable models. This section teaches you how to construct, train, evaluate, and deploy neural networks using tf.keras, TensorFlow’s high-level model API.

Whether you’re designing a simple feedforward neural network or preparing a model for production with callbacks and TensorBoard, this part forms the core skillset of any TensorFlow engineer.

Here’s what you’ll master across Chapters 13 to 20:  

✅ Chapter 13: TensorFlow Keras API – Anatomy of a Model  

You’ll explore how tf.keras is structured and learn three different ways to build models: Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing. This chapter is the gateway into deep learning architecture—laying the foundation for everything that follows.

✅ Chapter 14: Building a Neural Network from Scratch

Get hands-on with your first end-to-end model: from layer initialization to compiling and training it on actual data. You'll apply everything from Chapter 13 and feel what it’s like to breathe life into a neural net.

✅ Chapter 15: Layers & Activation Functions

Understand the different layer types (Dense, Conv2D, Dropout, etc.) and how to design them effectively. This chapter also dives into activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Softmax—and when to use them.

✅ Chapter 16: Loss Functions & Optimizers

Explore the mathematical functions that guide your model’s learning. You’ll learn when to use categorical crossentropy vs MSE, and how optimizers like Adam, SGD, and RMSprop affect convergence.

✅ Chapter 17: Backpropagation & Gradient Descent

Peek under the hood of how training actually works. This chapter demystifies backpropagation, how gradients flow through layers, and how loss and weight updates are calculated—bridging theory and TensorFlow code.

✅ Chapter 18: Model Training with fit() and evaluate()

This is where the magic happens: you’ll learn how to use Keras’s fit(), evaluate(), and predict() to handle training loops, batch sizes, and validation data—all with minimal code.

✅ Chapter 19: Saving, Loading, and Callbacks

Preserve your model with model.save(), reload it for inference, and customize training with callbacks like EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, and LearningRateScheduler—tools every serious model needs.

✅ Chapter 20: Visualizing Model Progress with TensorBoard

You’ll learn how to monitor model training in real time using TensorBoard, TensorFlow’s built-in visualization tool. This chapter introduces logs, scalars, histograms, and graphs for debugging and performance tracking.

After Part III, You Will Be Able To:

- Build models of increasing complexity, from scratch  

- Choose the right architecture, optimizer, and loss function  

- Train efficiently and debug performance issues  

- Save and serve your models  

- Visualize learning in real time with TensorBoard  

> Part III transforms you from a Tensor user into a TensorFlow builder.
