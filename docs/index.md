# TensorFlow Builderâ€™s Companion Book

Welcome to the **TensorFlow Builderâ€™s Companion Book** â€” your step-by-step guide to understanding the heart of TensorFlow through real-world reasoning, intuitive code walkthroughs, and progressively deeper system-level insights.

This book is structured for learners, builders, and AI engineers who want to move beyond plug-and-play Keras models and gain mastery over `tf`, the core engine that powers TensorFlow.

## What You'll Learn

- What `tf.Tensor` actually is and how TensorFlow represents computation.
- How to slice, reshape, broadcast, and train using tensors.
- A clear breakdown of every major API in TensorFlow, including:
  - `tf.Tensor`, `tf.Variable`, `tf.data`, `tf.GradientTape`
  - `tf.keras` (Sequential, Functional, Subclassing APIs)
  - `tf.function`, `tf.math`, `tf.strings`, `tf.sparse`, and more.
- How TensorFlow handles training, backpropagation, optimization, and deployment.
- Real-world debugging, GPU support, and model lifecycle management.
